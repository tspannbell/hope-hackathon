        <h2 class="head_one">Criminal opression in America</h2>
        <!-- Paragrahs -->
            <div class="main-info">
                <p>In 2016, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) gave a powerful speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Scott talked about how he had been repeatedly pulled over by police officers who seemed to be suspicious of a black man driving a nice car. He added that a black senior-level staffer had experienced the same thing and had even downgraded his car in the hope of avoiding the problem. Given that Scott otherwise has pretty conservative politics, there was little objection or protest from the right. No one rose up to say that he was lying about getting pulled over.

                    The thing is, most people of color have a similar story or know someone who does. Yet, there’s a deep skepticism on the right of any assertion that the criminal justice system is racially biased. In early August 2018, National Review editor and syndicated columnist Rich Lowry wrote a column disputing the notion that our system is racist. Andrew Sullivan wrote something similar in New York magazine. (Interestingly, both Lowry and Sullivan cite criminologist John Pfaff to support their positions. Pfaff has since protested on Twitter that both misinterpreted what he wrote.) And attempting to refute the notion that the system is racist has become a pretty regular beat for conservative crime pundit Heather Mac Donald.
                    
                    
                    Of particular concern to some on the right is the term “systemic racism,” often wrongly interpreted as an accusation that everyone in the system is racist. In fact, systemic racism means almost the opposite. It means that we have systems and institutions that produce racially disparate outcomes, regardless of the intentions of the people who work within them. When you consider that much of the criminal justice system was built, honed and firmly established during the Jim Crow era — an era almost everyone, conservatives included, will concede rife with racism — this is pretty intuitive. The modern criminal justice system helped preserve racial order — it kept black people in their place. For much of the early 20th century, in some parts of the country, that was its primary function. That it might retain some of those proclivities today shouldn’t be all that surprising. </p>

            <p>Black Americans are 2.5 times as likely to be killed by cops.
                Although blacks and Latinos together comprise just 30% of the general population, they account for 58% of the prison population.
                </p>
                <p>In 2013, over two-thirds of African Americans saw the criminal justice system as biased against blacks, in contrast to one-quarter of whites. 
                </p>
                <p>Low-income people of color have disproportionately borne the brunt of these policies. Nearly 60% of middle-aged African American men without a high school degree have served time in prison. And while blacks and Latinos together comprise 30% of the general population, they account for 58% of prisoners.
                </p>
                <p>The UCR classifies most Hispanics into the "white" category. The NCVS classifies some Hispanic criminals as "white" and some as "other race".Overall the FBI did not include a 'Latino' or 'Hispanic' category until recently and 93% of Hispanics are classified as "white" by law enforcement officers (irrespective of their ancestry) often inflating the amount of crimes attributed to whites.</p>

          <h2 class="head_one">Crime in Charlotte</h2>
          <div class="main-info">
            <p>With a crime rate of 44 per one thousand residents, Charlotte has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all communities of all sizes - from the smallest towns to the very largest cities. One's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in 23. In Charlotte, we found that the violent crime rate is one of the highest in the nation, across communities of all sizes (both large and small). Violent offenses tracked included rape, murder and non-negligent manslaughter, armed robbery, and aggravated assault, including assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>When researchers administered the IAT to judges and capital defense lawyers, they found that the majority of white and a minority of black judges and counsel exhibited bias favoring whites over African Americans
                </p>
                <p>When individuals believe that those who commit crime are similar to them, they more readily reflect on the underlying circumstances of the crime and respond with empathy and mercy. But when people perceive a racial gap between themselves and those who commit crime, they are less compassionate and react instead with anger and outrage.</p>
                <p>In large part because African Americans are more likely to experience concentrated urban poverty, they are more likely to commit certain violent and property crimes – although racial minorities buy and sell drugs at similar rates as whites. Yet racial disparities in criminal behavior fully explain neither the public’s racial perceptions of crime, nor the racial disparities in the prison population.
                </p>
                <p>If drug laws were equally enforced, prosecuted, and sentenced, the racial profile of drug offenders in the prison population would match that of the general population.
